Greetings,

another invite wave went out. Now Gistwiki and Bloodmallet(EU) from SE&L got access. This means, that SE&L is now able to provide first person impressions and better information than before. You can expect some more updates to existing pages for Shadowlands in the upcoming days. Let us know about your questions in discord. I'm looking forwards to hearing your feedback.

I'm working on getting near some target dummies to start testing stuff.

Yours sincerely,<br/>
Bloodmallet(EU)

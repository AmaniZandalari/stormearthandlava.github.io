Greetings,

our first few legendary effects were datamined. As always, nothing is
set in stone, but seeing them bundled up at one place might be nice.

### Ancestral Reminder
Bloodlust or any similar effects last an additional 20.0 sec on you, and you gain an extra 10% Haste from any Bloodlust type effect.

### Deeptremor Stone
Earth Elemental has a permanent Earthquake attached to it.

### Echoes of Great Sundering
When you consume 6 or more stacks of Fulmination with Earth Shock, your next Earthquake will be instant cast and deal 6% additional damage.

### Elemental Equilibrium
Dealing direct Fire damage increases the damage of your next Frost spell by 30%. Dealing Frost damage increases the damage of your next Nature spell by 25%. Dealing Nature damage increases the damage of your next Fire spell by 20%.

### Skybreaker's Fiery Demise
Flame Shock damage over time critical strikes reduce the cooldown of Storm Elemental / Fire Elemental by 1.0 sec, and Flame Shock has a 30% increased critical strike chance.

### Windspeaker's Lava Resurgence
When you consume 6 or more stacks of Fulmination with Earth Shock, gain Lava Surge and increase the damage of your next Lava Burst by 6%.

Found more? Let me know

Yours sincerely,<br/>
